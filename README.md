# GitHubStats
A small program that displays some information about an input GitHub account

## Installation

## Usage
Provides a small program that takes a GitHub account name as input, and displays three statistics about the account, namely:

- The account's oldest repository

- The account's most used language, and

- The different licences used by the account


To run the program, run the command "python3 GitHubStats.py" in the command line (make sure the command line path is set to the GitHubStats folder you downloaded. Also make sure that you have python installed).
The program will promt the user to enter a GitHub account name, and will then display the stats for that account, after which another account name can be inputted. Alternatively, "end session" can be inputted to end the program. Some example input:
